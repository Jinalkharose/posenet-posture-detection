# posenet-posture-detection

This project uses PoseNet, a machine learning model for pose estimation, to detect and analyze the posture of human subjects. By capturing video input from a camera, the model can detect the positions of various body parts and identify any deviations from proper posture.

This project also uses ml5.js, a friendly machine learning library for the web, to make it easy to work with the PoseNet model in a web-based environment.
